# Practice Git
Last spring, when I took the Introduction to AI Programming class, the professor introduced us to GitHub and helped us register there. However, we didn't do anything else with it, and I didnâ€™t really understand why we needed it for programming. This assignment helped me learn how to use Git and GitHub in a more practical way. Before, I only knew a little about Git, but now I understand how to create a project, save changes, and work with different versions.
I also learned how to create a new branch called dev. This is useful because it lets me work on changes separately before adding them to the main project. After making changes, I used a pull request to merge them into the main branch. This showed me how teams can work together on the same project without mixing up their changes.
Using GitHub made everything easier. I liked how pull requests let me review my work before adding it to the main project. I also found it helpful that GitHub keeps a history of all changes, so I can always go back if needed. Now I understand why GitHub is so popular for team projects.
Overall, this was a great learning experience. I feel more confident using Git and GitHub and will definitely use them in future projects.
